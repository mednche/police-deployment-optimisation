# Determining optimal police patrol deployments: a simulation-based optimisation approach combining Agent-Based Modelling and Genetic Algorithms.


## Project Description

This repository provides complementary code and data for the work undertaken during my PhD.




### Motivations: What problem does it solve? What your model does,

The model was build in a generic manner so as to be applied to any police force. It is made of two components:
- an Agent-Based Model that simulates the dispatching of police patrols throughout a given shift
- a Genetic Algorithm that searches for the optimal number and spatial positioning of police patrols.

- Why you used the technologies you used,

- Some of the challenges you faced and features you hope to implement in the future.




## Structure

The `src` folder contains the model codebase, split into an `ABM` folder -- containing the code for running the ABM on its own -- and a `GA` folder with the code to run the ABM-based (single and multi-objective) optimisation.


The folder `dpd_case_study` contains all the files pertaining to the case study on Detroit Police Department (DPD), Michigan. It contains a `data` folder with the datasets used in the case study, as well as a series of folders containing the code and results for various analyses conducted on the model:
- a sensitivity analysis on the ABM
- a validation of the ABM
- experiments using the ABM on DPD
- a tuning experiment for the RSS parameter of the single-objective GA
- results of the single and multi-objective GAs applied to DPD




## Installation

Key dependencies include (see provided yml file for versions that were used):

For the ABM:
- `osmnx` for downlading the road network of a police force and calculating fastest routes
- `networkX`for manipulating the road network graph generated by osmnx
- `geopandas` for manipulating the spatial dataframes generated by osmnx
- `imageio` for producing a GIF of the ABM
- `multiprocessing` (optional) to use multiple cores and thus speed up the running of the ABM

For the GA:
- `deap`

The `ABM` codebase is composed of the following files:
- `AgentFramework.py`: the attributes and methods for the agent entities
- `ModelFramework.py`: the model entity
- `SchedulerFramework.py`: the model scheduler 
- `IncidentFramework.py`: the attributes and methods for the incident entities
- `GraphFramework.py`: the attributes and methods for the road network (networkX graph and complimentary node and edge data)
- `BeatFramework.py`: the attributes and methods for the patrol beats
- `Env.py`: the initialisation of the model environment composed of the road network, the patrol beats and the incidents for the time period.




## Usage

### Example of DPD case study

#### Running the ABM for DPD
An example on how to run the ABM is provided in `dpd_case_study/ABM_running_example/ABM_running_example`.

For best results, it is recommended to harness the power of multiprocessing if you have a machien with multiple cores. 

#### Running the ABM+GA for DPD

Expected time of running the GA on multiprocessing 



### Using a custom police force

To run the ABM for a different police force, it is necessary to first aquire the following files and place them in the `data` folder: 

1. `G.gpickle` and `G_proj.gpickle`: using the jupyter notebook `dpd_case_study/getting_the_road_network`, download the road network for your chosen police force using osmnx and save the graph as `G.pickle` and its projected version as `G_proj.gpickle`. May need to provide a simple jupyter notebook for that.
2. `patrol_beats.shp`: Acquire the patrol beat shapefile and save as `patrol_beats.shp`.
3. Optional: for producing a GIF, the code requires a `precincts.shp` and a `stations.csv`, although these are optional.
